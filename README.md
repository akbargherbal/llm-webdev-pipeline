This repository explores a framework for using Large Language Models (LLMs) as proactive **Project Managers (PMs)** to orchestrate web development workflows, with a strong emphasis on **structured pipelines** and **automated verification**.

The primary focus is on building web applications using a modern stack like **Django, HTMX, and Alpine.js**, but the core principles are applicable more broadly.

## Core Concept

The central idea is to move beyond using LLMs as passive coding assistants (like Copilots) towards a model where the LLM takes initiative in:

1.  **Decomposing** high-level goals into manageable development stages (a pipeline).
2.  **Orchestrating** the execution of tasks within each stage (code generation, tool usage).
3.  **Selecting and Utilizing** appropriate tools (linters, testers like Pytest/Playwright, accessibility checkers, etc.).
4.  **Verifying** the output of each stage through rigorous automated checks before proceeding.

## Problem Addressed

*   **LLM Passivity:** Current LLMs generally require explicit, step-by-step instructions.
*   **Complexity Management:** LLM performance degrades on large, unstructured tasks. Pipelines provide necessary structure.
*   **Trust and Reliability:** AI-generated code requires robust verification to ensure correctness, security, and quality. Automated checks are essential for building trust and enabling autonomy.

## Repository Contents

This repository primarily contains the documentation and conceptual framework for this approach:

*   **Guide Content:** Detailed chapters exploring the vision, pipeline architecture, verification toolkit, practical implementation, challenges, and future directions. (Located in files like `01-introduction-...md`, `02-...md`, etc.)
    *   **Part 1:** The Vision and Foundations
    *   **Part 2:** Designing the AI-Driven Workflow
    *   **Part 3:** Practical Implementation and Execution
    *   **Part 4:** Looking Ahead
*   **Project Template:** A detailed, stage-by-stage pipeline template for Django/HTMX/Alpine.js development, including objectives, deliverables, and verification checklists. (See `0X-...template.md` or similar)
*   **Appendix:** Glossary of terms, explanation of concepts (ARIA, WCAG, Testing types, Tools), and potentially example prompts or configurations. (See `0X-...appendix.md` or similar)
*   **(Future):** Potentially example scripts, orchestration code snippets, or sample project implementations.

## Getting Started

1.  **Read the Guide:** Start by reading the guide content, beginning with **Part 1** (`01-...md`, `02-...md`) to understand the core concepts and vision.
2.  **Review the Pipeline Template:** Explore the detailed pipeline structure and checklists designed for the target stack.
3.  **Consult the Appendix:** Use the appendix to clarify unfamiliar terms or concepts.

## Vision

The ultimate goal is to develop methodologies and tools that enable higher levels of reliable automation in software development, allowing human developers to focus on strategic direction, complex problem-solving, and ensuring alignment with user needs and quality standards.
