**1. Core Development Concepts**

*   **Incremental Development:**
    *   **What:** A strategy of building software in small, manageable steps or increments. Each increment adds a piece of functionality and is fully tested.
    *   **Why:** Reduces complexity by tackling one layer at a time. Allows for earlier feedback and easier debugging if issues arise. Makes large projects less overwhelming. The template follows this by moving from static HTML to client-side JS, then backend integration, then HTMX dynamism.
*   **Automated Verification:**
    *   **What:** Using software tools to automatically check if code meets requirements, follows standards, or functions correctly. This includes running tests, linters, and checkers.
    *   **Why:** Catches errors early and consistently, much faster than manual checking. Provides confidence that changes haven't broken existing functionality. Essential for enabling faster development cycles and minimizing the need to fix bugs introduced much earlier. This is the foundation of the template's checkpoints.
*   **Minimizing Backtracking:**
    *   **What:** Reducing the need to go back and fix issues introduced in earlier stages of development.
    *   **Why:** Backtracking is time-consuming and costly. Fixing a bug found late is much harder than preventing it or catching it early. The template's emphasis on verification at *each* stage is designed specifically to prevent regressions and minimize backtracking.
*   **Dependency Management:**
    *   **What:** Keeping track of external libraries and packages your project relies on (e.g., Django, requests). Tools like `pip` and files like `requirements.txt` are used for this.
    *   **Why:** Ensures that all developers (and deployment environments) use the same versions of external code, preventing "works on my machine" problems and ensuring compatibility.

**2. Key Technologies & Frameworks**

*   **Django:**
    *   **What:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern.
    *   **Why:** Provides a robust structure for building complex web applications, including an ORM, templating engine, form handling, admin interface, security features, and more, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than boilerplate.
*   **HTMX:**
    *   **What:** A JavaScript library that allows you to access modern browser features (like AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets) directly from HTML using attributes, rather than writing lots of JavaScript.
    *   **Why:** Simplifies creating dynamic interfaces by allowing the server (Django) to send back HTML snippets instead of JSON data, reducing the need for complex client-side JavaScript logic to handle data fetching and UI updates. Enables partial page updates for a smoother user experience.
*   **Alpine.js:**
    *   **What:** A rugged, minimal JavaScript framework for adding behavior (interactivity) to your HTML markup. Often used for small UI components like dropdowns, modals, tabs, etc., directly within the HTML.
    *   **Why:** Provides a simple way to add client-side interactivity without the complexity of larger frameworks like React or Vue. Works well alongside server-rendered HTML (like Django templates) and HTMX.
*   **Tailwind CSS:**
    *   **What:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Instead of pre-defined components, it provides low-level utility classes (e.g., `pt-4` for padding-top, `flex` for flexbox) to be composed directly in your HTML markup.
    *   **Why:** Offers immense flexibility in design without writing custom CSS. Encourages consistency and makes responsive design easier with built-in modifiers. Reduces the need to name things in CSS and avoids style conflicts.

**3. Testing & Verification Concepts**

*   **Unit Testing:**
    *   **What:** Testing individual, isolated parts (units) of code, like a specific function or method in a Django model or view helper.
    *   **Why:** Verifies that the smallest pieces of your code work correctly in isolation. Fast to run and helps pinpoint errors accurately. Essential for backend logic.
*   **Integration Testing:**
    *   **What:** Testing the interaction *between* different parts of the system. For example, testing if a Django view correctly fetches data from the model and passes it to the template.
    *   **Why:** Ensures that different components work together as expected. Catches errors that might occur at the boundaries between units.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   **What:** Testing the entire application flow from the user's perspective, typically using a browser automation tool like Playwright. Simulates real user actions (clicking buttons, filling forms) and verifies the final UI output and behavior.
    *   **Why:** Provides the highest level of confidence that the application works correctly as a whole, including frontend interactivity (Alpine.js) and backend communication (HTMX responses). Essential for verifying user journeys.
*   **Visual Regression Testing:**
    *   **What:** Automatically comparing screenshots of UI components or pages against previously approved "baseline" images to detect unintended visual changes (layout shifts, style breakages).
    *   **Why:** Catches visual bugs that might not be caught by functional tests. Ensures UI consistency across changes. Particularly useful for CSS refactoring or dependency updates.
*   **Baseline Image:**
    *   **What:** An approved reference screenshot used in visual regression testing. Future screenshots are compared against this baseline.
    *   **Why:** Acts as the "source of truth" for what the UI *should* look like. Baselines usually need initial human approval.

**4. Testing & Verification Tools**

*   **Playwright:**
    *   **What:** A Node.js library (with Python bindings) for automating browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
    *   **Why:** Used extensively in the template for E2E testing, accessibility checks (`axe-core` integration), visual regression testing, and verifying HTMX/Alpine.js interactions by simulating real user behavior in a browser.
*   **Pytest:**
    *   **What:** A popular, feature-rich testing framework for Python. Often used with plugins (`pytest-django`) for testing Django applications.
    *   **Why:** Makes writing and running unit and integration tests simpler and more powerful than Python's built-in `unittest`. Provides features like fixtures, better assertions, and detailed reporting.
*   **Django Test Client:**
    *   **What:** A Python class provided by Django (`django.test.Client`) that allows you to simulate HTTP requests (GET, POST) to your Django application within your tests, without needing a running web server.
    *   **Why:** Essential for integration testing Django views, checking responses, verifying template rendering, and testing form submissions from the backend perspective.
*   **`manage.py check`:**
    *   **What:** A Django command that checks the entire Django project for common problems, such as issues in models, settings, or configurations, without running tests or needing database connections.
    *   **Why:** A quick first pass to catch basic configuration or model definition errors early.
*   **`manage.py test`:**
    *   **What:** The primary Django command used to discover and run your application's automated tests (typically using `unittest` or `pytest` configured via `pytest-django`).
    *   **Why:** The standard way to execute your backend unit and integration test suite.

**5. Accessibility Concepts (ARIA, WCAG)**

*   **Accessibility (a11y):**
    *   **What:** Designing and building web applications so that people with disabilities (visual, auditory, motor, cognitive) can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with them effectively.
    *   **Why:** It's crucial for inclusivity, ensuring everyone can access information and services. Often a legal requirement (e.g., ADA, Section 508). Improves usability for *all* users.
*   **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications):**
    *   **What:** A set of attributes you can add to HTML elements (e.g., `role="navigation"`, `aria-label="Close"`, `aria-expanded="false"`).
    *   **Why:** Provides extra semantic information to assistive technologies (like screen readers) about widgets, structures, and behaviors, especially for dynamic content and custom controls built with JavaScript (like those using Alpine.js). Helps make complex UI elements understandable and operable for users of assistive tech.
*   **WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines):**
    *   **What:** An internationally recognized set of guidelines and success criteria for making web content accessible. Provides different levels of conformance (A, AA, AAA).
    *   **Why:** The standard benchmark for web accessibility. Following WCAG helps ensure your site meets legal requirements and provides a good experience for users with disabilities. Tools like Axe check against WCAG criteria.
*   **Color Contrast:**
    *   **What:** The difference in perceived brightness between foreground text (or UI element) and its background color.
    *   **Why:** Sufficient contrast is essential for people with low vision or color blindness to read text and identify UI elements. WCAG defines specific minimum contrast ratios.
*   **Axe-core:**
    *   **What:** An open-source accessibility testing engine/library.
    *   **Why:** Can be run automatically (e.g., via Playwright) to detect common accessibility violations based on WCAG standards directly in your tests. Helps catch issues like insufficient contrast, missing image alt text, improper ARIA usage, etc.

**6. Code Quality & Linting Tools**

*   **Linter:**
    *   **What:** A tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs.
    *   **Why:** Enforces coding standards, improves code quality and consistency, catches potential bugs before runtime. Makes code easier to read and maintain for the whole team.
*   **Ruff / Flake8 / Pylint (Python Linters):**
    *   **What:** Specific linters for Python code. `Ruff` is notably very fast.
    *   **Why:** Check for Python syntax errors, style guide violations (PEP 8), unused variables, potential bugs, etc.
*   **ESLint (JavaScript Linter):**
    *   **What:** A widely used linter for JavaScript code.
    *   **Why:** Catches errors and enforces style in JavaScript, important even for the smaller scripts used in Alpine.js directives.
*   **Stylelint (CSS Linter):**
    *   **What:** A linter for CSS code. Can be configured with plugins for specific methodologies like Tailwind CSS.
    *   **Why:** Enforces CSS best practices, catches errors, ensures consistency in styling approaches.
*   **djlint (Django Template Linter):**
    *   **What:** A specialized linter and formatter for Django templates (HTML with Django tags), and also supports Jinja, Nunjucks, Handlebars, and Go templates.
    *   **Why:** Catches syntax errors in Django template tags/filters and can enforce HTML formatting/best practices within templates.
*   **HTML Validation (W3C):**
    *   **What:** Checking HTML markup against the official standards defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
    *   **Why:** Ensures your HTML is well-formed and likely to render predictably across different browsers. Can catch errors like unclosed tags or improperly nested elements.

**7. Django Specifics**

*   **`settings.py`:**
    *   **What:** The main configuration file for a Django project. Contains database settings, installed apps, middleware, template configurations, static file settings, etc.
    *   **Why:** Central place to manage how your Django project behaves.
*   **`models.py`:**
    *   **What:** File within a Django app where you define your data models (database tables) as Python classes.
    *   **Why:** Defines the structure of your application's data. Django's ORM uses these models to interact with the database.
*   **ORM (Object-Relational Mapper):**
    *   **What:** A technique (and library provided by Django) that lets you interact with your database (querying, saving data) using Python objects (your models) instead of writing raw SQL queries.
    *   **Why:** Abstracts away database differences, prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities (when used correctly), and makes database interactions more Pythonic and often easier to write and maintain.
*   **Migrations (`makemigrations`, `migrate`):**
    *   **What:** Django's system for managing changes to your database schema (table structure) as your models evolve. `makemigrations` detects changes in `models.py` and creates migration files; `migrate` applies these changes to the database.
    *   **Why:** Provides a reliable, repeatable, and version-controlled way to update your database structure across different environments (development, testing, production).
*   **Views (`views.py`):**
    *   **What:** Python functions or classes within a Django app that receive an HTTP request and return an HTTP response. They contain the business logic to process requests, interact with models, and select/render templates.
    *   **Why:** The core logic handlers of your web application. Connect URLs to data processing and responses.
*   **Templates (`templates/` directory):**
    *   **What:** Files (usually HTML) containing static content and placeholders for dynamic data. Django's templating engine processes these files to generate the final HTML sent to the browser.
    *   **Why:** Separate the presentation logic (HTML structure) from the business logic (Python view code). Allows designers and developers to work more independently.
*   **Context Data:**
    *   **What:** A Python dictionary passed from a Django view to a template. The keys in the dictionary become variables accessible within the template.
    *   **Why:** The mechanism for injecting dynamic data (fetched from models or calculated in the view) into the HTML output.
*   **`base.html` & Template Inheritance:**
    *   **What:** A common pattern where a base template (`base.html`) defines the main HTML structure (doctype, head, body, common header/footer), and specific page templates "extend" this base and override defined blocks (like `{% block content %}`).
    *   **Why:** Reduces repetition by defining common layout elements only once. Makes site-wide changes easier.
*   **Partials / Includes:**
    *   **What:** Smaller, reusable template snippets (e.g., a navigation bar, a form component) stored in separate files and included in other templates using the `{% include %}` tag.
    *   **Why:** Promotes modularity and reusability within templates. Makes complex pages easier to manage. Crucial for HTMX, which often involves swapping these partials.
*   **`request.htmx`:**
    *   **What:** An attribute added to Django's request object (by `django-htmx` middleware or similar) that evaluates to `True` if the request was made by HTMX (indicated by the `HX-Request` header).
    *   **Why:** Allows views to easily differentiate between a full page load request and a subsequent HTMX request, enabling them to return either a full HTML document or just an HTML partial as needed.

**8. Frontend Specifics (HTML, CSS, JS)**

*   **Semantic HTML:**
    *   **What:** Using HTML elements according to their intended purpose or meaning (e.g., `<nav>` for navigation, `<article>` for main content, `<aside>` for sidebars, `<button>` for clickable actions).
    *   **Why:** Improves accessibility (screen readers understand the structure better), SEO (search engines understand content hierarchy), and code maintainability/readability.
*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   **What:** Designing web pages so they adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
    *   **Why:** Ensures a good user experience for everyone, regardless of the device they use. Crucial in today's multi-device world. Tailwind CSS provides utility classes to make this easier.
*   **Viewport:**
    *   **What:** The user's visible area of a web page. Its size varies depending on the device screen size and browser window. The `<meta name="viewport">` tag is used to control how content scales and sizes on mobile devices.
    *   **Why:** Controlling the viewport is essential for implementing effective responsive design.
*   **DOM (Document Object Model):**
    *   **What:** A programming interface for HTML documents. It represents the page structure as a tree of objects (nodes). JavaScript (and tools like Playwright) can interact with the DOM to change the document structure, style, or content dynamically.
    *   **Why:** The fundamental way JavaScript interacts with and manipulates a web page's content and structure after it loads. Understanding the DOM is key to debugging frontend issues.
*   **Hardcoded Data:**
    *   **What:** Data values written directly into the source code (e.g., text in an HTML file, a list in a JavaScript variable) instead of being loaded dynamically from a database or API.
    *   **Why:** Useful in early stages (like Stages 2 & 3) to build UI and interactivity without needing a working backend. Should be replaced with dynamic data later.

**9. General Terminology**

*   **Deliverables:**
    *   **What:** The tangible outputs produced at the end of a project stage or task (e.g., code files, test reports, documentation, configuration files).
    *   **Why:** Provide concrete evidence that a stage's objectives have been met. Serve as inputs for subsequent stages.
*   **Checklist:**
    *   **What:** A list of items (usually verification steps or tasks) to be completed or checked off.
    *   **Why:** Provides a clear, structured way to track progress and ensure all necessary verification steps for a stage have been performed and passed. Useful for both humans and LLM agents managing the process.
*   **Milestone / Checkpoint:**
    *   **What:** A specific point in the project timeline, usually marking the completion of a significant phase or stage. Often associated with specific deliverables and verification.
    *   **Why:** Breaks down a large project into smaller, trackable parts. Provides points for review and decision-making (e.g., proceed, correct course).
*   **Pipeline:**
    *   **What:** A defined sequence of stages or steps through which work flows from start to completion. In this context, the series of development and verification stages.
    *   **Why:** Provides a structured and repeatable process for building software, ensuring necessary steps (like testing) are consistently followed.
